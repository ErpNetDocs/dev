# Working with documents

See [Documents](xref:Documents) on technical documentation.

Retrieving and updating documents is the same as any other entity in the domain.

However there are some specific rules that apply only to documents. For example documents on state Released or above can not be modified directly. They must be modified with Adjustment Documents. [Adjustment Documents](xref:Adjustment Documents)

Another important attribute of the documents that can not be modified with simple PATCH request is [State](xref:Document States)

The examples below show some tasks related to documents.
