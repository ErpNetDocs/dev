# Query Options

Query options allow you to control the amount and order of the data that a data service returns for the resource identified by the URI.

OData system query options are provided by the OData framework and documented in detail in the OData specification at <http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part2-url-conventions.html>.

For a great introduction to query options, read the [OData query data tutorial](https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/#queryData).
