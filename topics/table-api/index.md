# Table API

The primary purpose of the Table API is to allow external BI (Business Intelligence) tools to quickly pull raw data for further analysis.

## Authentication

The Table API supports the following types of authentication:
* OAuth 2.0
* Basic Authentication

> [!CAUTION]
> Although Basic Authentication is supported, its use is strongly **NOT** recommended, because of its significantly lower level of security.

For more information, see [Authentication](../authentication/index.md).

## Tables

For information about the tables, which can be queried, see the [Table Model](https://docs.erp.net/model/tables/).
