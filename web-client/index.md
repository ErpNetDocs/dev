# Developing for WebClient

## Overview

ERP.net WebClient can be extended through a centralized **extensions registry**.

An extension is a registration record that allows an application to extend WebClient behavior at predefined extension points (paths). A primary use case is registering additional applications in the WebClient **Main menu**.
