# Domain API 

## Introduction

The Domain API is the primary API for accessing and manipulating data in @@name.
It is most useful for UI and service apps.
For BI, you should use the [Table API](~/topics/table-api/index.md).

For an overview and introduction of the Domain API, read the thorough presentation at the [home page of the developer docs](~/index.md#the-domain-api).

## Based on OData

The Domain API is based on the [OData protocol](https://www.odata.org/).
It allows object-oriented access to the data exposed by the @@name domain objects.

The OData API is structured along a number of entity types (called "repositories" in @@name), that represent the Domain Model of the ERP Instance.
Each entity type contains data attributes, which can be filtered, sorted, etc.
The model also provides information on how to navigate between the repositories.

For a quick introduction to OData, check the beginners tutorial at the OData site:
