# Build Payment Connector

The Payment Connector sample demonstrates connecting ERP.net with Stripe.

The app demonstrates simplified workflow:

1. Internal user logins interactively.
2. The most recent 10 payment orders, accessible by the user, are displayed.
3. The user chooses a payment order.
4. The selected payment order is exported to a demo Stripe account.
5. After a demo payment is made, the app creates a Payment Transaction with the payment details.

The app includes the following basic tasks:

1. Register UI app.
2. Login interactive.
3. List Payment Orders.
4. Create Payment Transaction.

The app is written entirely in JavaScript and hosted in GitHub Pages.
