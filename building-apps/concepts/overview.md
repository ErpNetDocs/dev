# Concepts Overview

This section describes the structural concepts that underpin all @@name integrations.

It explains how @@name is organized from the perspective of an external application: how systems are segmented into instances, how applications are categorized, where integration endpoints live, and which security assumptions apply when calling APIs.

The topics here establish shared terminology and boundaries that are used consistently throughout the **Building Apps** documentation.

## What This Section Covers

This section focuses on:

- how an @@name **instance** is defined and why apps are always bound to a specific instance
- how **application types** describe common integration patterns and expected behavior
- how apps reach the platform through **application server endpoints**
- what it means to **call APIs securely** in the context of @@name
- the terminology used across documentation and configuration screens

## What This Section Does Not Cover

This section does not provide:

- step-by-step implementation guidance
- authentication or token acquisition walkthroughs
- API usage examples or payload references

Those topics are covered in dedicated sections.

## How to Use This Section

Use this section as a reference when:

- deciding how an app should be structured
- interpreting configuration options or documentation language
- clarifying boundaries between identity, APIs, and instances

If you want to start building immediately, proceed to [**Getting Started**](../getting-started/overview.md).  
If something later feels unclear or ambiguous, this section defines the underlying concepts.
