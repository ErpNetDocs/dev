# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the minimum steps required to build a working integration with @@name.

By following this guide, you will register an app, authenticate it, and successfully call an @@name API against a real instance.

## What This Guide Covers

The Getting Started flow consists of the following steps:

1. Verify prerequisites and access to an @@name instance  
2. Register your app as a **Trusted Application**  
3. Obtain an access token  
4. Make a successful API call  

Each step builds on the previous one and results in a verifiable outcome.

## Expected Outcome

At the end of this guide, you will have:

- A registered **Trusted Application**
- A working method for obtaining access tokens
- A successful API call returning a valid response
