# Next Steps

You have successfully authenticated your app and made an API call against an @@name instance.

From here, the next steps depend on what you are building.

## Work with Business Data (Domain API)

If your app works with business objects or modifies data, start with the Domain API:

- [Domain API Introduction](../../domain-api/index.md)  
  Overview of the Domain API, data model, and general principles.

- [Querying Data](../../domain-api/querying-data/index.md)  
  Filtering, paging, sorting, and querying entities.

- [Data Manipulation](../../domain-api/data-manipulation/index.md)  
  Creating, updating, and deleting business objects.

- [Common Tasks](../../domain-api/common-tasks/index.md)  
  Practical patterns for frequent integration scenarios.

- [Example Apps](../../domain-api/samples/index.md)  
  End-to-end examples demonstrating real integrations.

## Analytics and Reporting (Table API)

If your integration focuses on analytics, reporting, or bulk data access:

- [Table API Overview](../../table-api/index.md)  
  Read-only, high-performance access to raw table data.

- [Power BI Usage Guidelines](../../table-api/usage-guide.md)  
  Recommended patterns for reporting and analytics workloads.

## Review Authentication and Security

Before moving to production, review:

- [Authentication and Authorization](../../auth/overview.md)  
  Identity model, tokens, flows, and scopes.

- [Security Best Practices](../../auth/security-best-practices.md)  
  Token handling, secrets, least privilege, and auditing.

At this point, you have a working integration and can proceed with deeper implementation using the sections above.
