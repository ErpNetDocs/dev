# Overview

This section complements the reference topics in **Authentication and Authorization** with practical guidance: example integrations, security recommendations, and answers to common questions.

If you're looking for step-by-step scenario tutorials (SPA, web apps, service apps), start with [Getting Started (Authentication)](../getting-started/overview.md). If you need the core auth reference (trusted apps, scopes, flows, tokens, sessions), use the other sections in this topic.
