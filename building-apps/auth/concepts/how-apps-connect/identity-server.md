# @@name Identity

Every @@name instance includes a built-in **Identity** that acts as its authentication and authorization authority.

It handles sign-in, token issuance, and access control for all users, apps, and services that connect to the instance.

## What the @@name Identity does

@@name Identity is responsible for:

- Authenticating users and service accounts
- Applying instance-level security and sign-in policies
- Issuing OAuth 2.0 tokens used to access @@name APIs
- Managing logout and session lifecycles

Think of it as the gatekeeper of an @@name instance: it verifies who is requesting access, confirms what they are allowed to do, and issues a signed token if the request is permitted.

> [!Note]
> @@name Identity acts as both an authorization server (issuing tokens) and an authentication server (verifying credentials).

## @@name Identity location

Each @@name instance hosts its own @@name Identity, typically available at:

```http
https://{instance-root}/id
```

For example, @@name Identity for the `testdb` instance is:
https://testdb.my.erp.net/id

You can discover this automatically through the system's discovery endpoint (see below).

## Discovering the @@name Identity

Every @@name instance exposes an **auto-discovery endpoint** that lists all available sites and services - including @@name Identity, Domain API, and other functional components.

This allows developers (and tools) to dynamically determine where to send authentication and API requests.

**Request:**

```http
GET https://{instance-root}/sys/auto-discovery
```

```http
GET https://testdb.my.erp.net/sys/auto-discovery
```

**Response (truncated):**

```json
{
  "WebSites": [
    {
      "Type": "ID",
      "Status": "Working",
      "Url": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id"
    },
    {
      "Type": "DomainAPI",
      "Status": "Working",
      "Url": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/api",
      "AdditionalProperties": {
        "ODataServiceRoot": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/api/domain/odata/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells you that the instance's @@name Identity is active at /id, and that the Domain API is available at /api.

## Standard endpoints

@@name Identity exposes the standard OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints. The most commonly used ones are:

### 1) Discovery endpoint

The **discovery endpoint** provides metadata about @@name Identity - including its issuer name, supported scopes, signing keys, and the exact URLs for authentication, token exchange, and logout.

This information helps client libraries and apps automatically configure themselves without hardcoding endpoints.

**Request:**

```http
GET https://{instance-root}/id/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```http
GET https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

**Example response (truncated):**

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/connect/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/connect/token",
  "end_session_endpoint": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/connect/endsession",
  "jwks_uri": "https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks",
  "response_types_supported": [
    "code",
    "token",
    "id_token",
    "code id_token"
  ],
  "grant_types_supported": [
    "authorization_code",
    "client_credentials",
    "refresh_token"
  ],
  "scopes_supported": [
    "openid",
    "profile",
    "offline_access",
    "update"
  ]
}
```

**Key properties:**

- **issuer** - The base URL identifying @@name Identity. Used to validate tokens issued by this instance.
- **authorization_endpoint** - The URL where interactive user logins begin (used in the Authorization Code flow).
- **token_endpoint** - The URL used by apps to exchange authorization codes or client credentials for access tokens.
- **end_session_endpoint** - The logout URL used to terminate user sessions and trigger single sign-out.
- **jwks_uri** - Location of the public signing keys used to validate tokens issued by this @@name Identity.
- **grant_types_supported** - Lists which OAuth 2.0 grant types (flows) are available.
- **scopes_supported** - Lists available permission scopes that can be requested in tokens.

> [!NOTE]
> The discovery document is automatically generated by each instance's @@name Identity and always reflects its current configuration.
> Applications should use it dynamically rather than hardcoding endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> Client libraries typically fetch this automatically to configure themselves.

### 2) Authorize endpoint

Starts an interactive sign-in and authorization request. Used by apps that act on behalf of a user (Authorization Code flow).

```http
GET https://{instance-root}/id/connect/authorize
```

**Example request:**

```http
GET https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/connect/authorize?
  client_id=MyApp&
  redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.com%2Fcallback&
  response_type=code&
  scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&
  state=xyz123
```

After successful sign-in, the browser is redirected to redirect_uri with an code parameter that the app will exchange for tokens.

### 3) Token endpoint

Exchanges an authorization code or client credentials for access tokens (and refresh tokens where applicable).

```http
POST https://{instance-root}/id/connect/token
```

**Example: exchange authorization code:**

```http
POST /id/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=MyApp&
client_secret=secret&
grant_type=authorization_code&
code=abc123&
redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.com%2Fcallback
```

**Example response: exchange authorization code:**

```http
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "df9834jf...",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access"
}
```

**Example: client credentials:**

```http
POST /id/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=MyServiceApp&
client_secret=secret&
grant_type=client_credentials&
scope=update
```

**Example response: client credentials:**

```http
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "read update"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Refresh tokens are issued only for suitable interactive confidential clients using Authorization Code flow.
> They are not issued for Client Credentials.

### 4) End session endpoint

Triggers logout and single sign-out across participating apps.

```http
GET https://{instance-root}/id/connect/endsession
```

**Example: end session:**

```http
GET https://testdb.my.erp.net/id/connect/endsession?
  id_token_hint=eyJhbGciOi...&
  post_logout_redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.com%2Flogout-complete
```

## Internal and external users

@@name Identity can authenticate both:

- **Internal users** - Licensed users who can open sessions and access instance data through APIs. Internal users can obtain access tokens for Domain API and Table API, depending on scopes and permissions.

- **External users** - Community or customer users who can authenticate but typically cannot access data APIs directly. For these users, @@name Identity issues identity tokens for sign-in to external-facing apps (for example, portals), but not API-access tokens for Domain API or Table API.

## Typical flows at a glance

- **Authorization Code** - Interactive apps acting on behalf of a signed-in user. The app redirects to @@name Identity, gets a code, exchanges it for tokens.

- **Client Credentials** - Service or background apps acting as themselves. The app directly requests a token from @@name Identity using its client credentials.

- **Reference tokens (API keys: PAT/SAT)** - Opaque, manually issued tokens that represent long-lived delegated access. They are looked up by the instance on each request.
