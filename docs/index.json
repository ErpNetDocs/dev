    "keywords": "ERP Instance Each tenant in the ERP.net infrastructure is called an ERP Instance. General info When a client creates a subscription with the ERP.net service, they get an ERP Instance. A single account can create and manage more than one ERP Instance. This might be required for testing, validation or other purposes. Note A single ERP Instance can manage multiple legal entities (companies). Under the hood, each ERP Instance is managed as a single database. For this reason, the terms ERP Instance and database are sometimes used interchangeably. The proper term is ERP Instance, since this is more abstract and not related to any underlying technology. The ERP Instances are provided as a service from the ERP.net infrastructure and the actual storage is undistinguishable to the end user. UIN Each ERP Instance has a Unique Instance Name (UIN) or simply name. For example, the demonstration database is named \"demodb\". Root URL The ERP Instances are accessible through their root URL address. The root URL address is https://<<UIN>>.my.erp.net For example, the root URL of demodb is: https://demodb.my.erp.net You can go ahead and click that address. It opens the home page of the ERP Instance. For security reasons, it does not give access to much else than some general info and public downloads. The root URL is usually also used as base address for the instance-related web sites. For example, demodb has several web sites active. One of the sites is the Domain API site, available at: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api Note The web sites can be hosted at custom URL addresses. Using the Root URL is just a default."

    "keywords": "Register Trusted Application In this topic, you register an app in an ERP instance so the ERP.net identity server can provide authentication and authorization services for your application and its users. Each application that uses ERP.net APIs needs to be registered. Whether it's a client application like a web or mobile app, or it's a web API that backs a client app, registering it establishes a trust relationship between your application and the ERP instance. Register an application Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the ERP.net database instance. That means that your database trusts the application. We'll show how to register an application manually, using the Domain API Query Tool. Follow these steps to create the app registration: Sign in to your ERP instance and open the Domain API Query Tool. In this example we'll use the DEMODB ERP.net instance: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/query You need to be a database administrator in order to be able to register a new trusted application. If the application is confidential , we need to prepare an application secret. Use this endpoint to get the application secret hash (Replace mysecret with your secret): https://demodb.my.erp.net/sys/tools/sha256?secret=mysecret In the query tool we'll create a new record for System.Security.TrustedApplications entity. Register interactive confidential application Query : Systems_Security_TrustedApplications Type : POST Body : { \"ApplicationUri\": \"MYDEMOCLIENT\", \"Name\": \"MY DEMO CLIENT\", \"ClientType\": \"Confidential\", \"ApplicationSecretHash\": \"T/AGymuI51LwjLeIFxRQXOs9IHnupDKs/ajhWODR2C4=\", \"ImpersonateAsCommunityUserAllowed\": true, \"ImpersonateAsInternalUserAllowed\": true, \"ImpersonateLoginUrl\": \"http://localhost:5080/myapp/signin-oidc\", \"ImpersonateLogoutUrl\": \"http://localhost:5080/myapp/\", \"SystemUserAllowed\": false } ApplicationUri is the unique name that identifies the application. This is the client_id in the OAuth terminology. Name is the display name of the application. ClientType - Confidential or Public. ApplicationSecretHash a hash of the application secret - previously created using https://demodb.my.erp.net/sys/tools/sha256?secret=mysecret tool. ImpersonateAsCommunityUserAllowed must be true if your application will work with community users. Community users are users that do not have access to system resources. They are usually customers of the company that owns the ERP.net database instance. ImpersonateAsInternalUserAllowed must be true if internal users will use the application. ImpersonateLoginUrl is the url that receives the authorization code. When the user loads the application in the browser, if sign in is required, the browser is redirected to ERP.net Identity Server login page. After successful login the browser is redirected to ImpersonateLoginUrl providing the authorization_code through code url parameter. This code is used by the application to request an access_code that is used to gain access to ERP.net server resources. ImpersonateLogoutUrl is the url that is loaded after the user is logged out from the identity server and \"Return to app\" button is clicked. SystemUserAllowed specifies if the application can act as a service application that is impersonated as specific user. Register interactive public application Query : Systems_Security_TrustedApplications Type : POST Body : { \"ApplicationUri\": \"MYDEMOCLIENT\", \"Name\": \"MY DEMO CLIENT\", \"ClientType\": \"Public\", \"ImpersonateAsCommunityUserAllowed\": true, \"ImpersonateAsInternalUserAllowed\": true, \"ImpersonateLoginUrl\": \"http://localhost:5080/myapp/signin-oidc\", \"ImpersonateLogoutUrl\": \"http://localhost:5080/myapp/\", \"SystemUserAllowed\": false } Register service application Query : Systems_Security_TrustedApplications Type : POST Body : { \"ApplicationUri\": \"MYSERVICEDEMOCLIENT\", \"Name\": \"Service Demo Client\", \"ApplicationSecretHash\": \"T/AGymuI51LwjLeIFxRQXOs9IHnupDKs/ajhWODR2C4=\", \"ClientType\": \"Confidential\", \"SystemUserAllowed\": true, \"SystemUser\": { \"@odata.id\": \"Systems_Security_Users(cc314327-3d04-477f-ac53-cde19d8350e9)\" } } SystemUser is the user for the service application."

    "keywords": "Welcome to the ERP.net Developer Documentation Here you will find all the necessary resources for building applications targeting the ERP.net services. This documentation contains developer resources. For business logic and other technical documentation, you might want to check the Technical Documentation . ERP Instances The ERP.net service is a hosted ERP service. Accessing the data is done through ERP Instances. When you sign up at erp.net , you can create and manage a new ERP Instance. An ERP Instance is a tenant in the hosting environment. It is multi-company, e.g. it allows managing multiple related legal entities (companies) in one instance. You don't need to create separate instances for each managed company. Each ERP Instance has a unique name. The instance can be accessed at: https://<<instance_name>>.my.erp.net For example, the demonstration database, DEMODB, is located at: https://demodb.my.erp.net The API Each ERP Instance CAN have an API site. It \"can\" have, because, the API is a site, similar to other sites, which the instance can launch. In order for the API to function, it needs to be configured and launched for the ERP Instance. The common URL for the API site is /api/ inside the ERP instance. For example, the DEMODB has API site at: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/ The Domain API The Domain API is the primary means for accessing and manipulating data in the ERP Instance. It can currently be consumed in OData 4 format. The Domain API is an API proxy for the object-oriented Domain Model of ERP.net. It is targeted towards UI and service apps. These kind of apps usually read and update moderate amounts of data. The Domain API is NOT adequate for read-only dumping of very large amounts of data, which is usually done by BI applications. BI applications should find other solutions or try to read data by small chunks. The Domain API is located at /domain/odata/ within the API site. For DEMODB, this is at: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/odata/ Tip User: Admin Password: 123 If you try the above link, it will ask you for user credentials. Most ERP Instances should, by default, be configured to NOT accept basic authentication. However, for demonstration purposes, DEMODB is configured to allow it. Sample Query OData v4 allows the creation of URL-based queries. For example, to take the first 10 products (in undefined order), you can use: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/odata/General_Products_Products?$top=10 NOTE: The above will return unformatted JSON result, intended to be consumed by client app. For a quick overview of OData, see this topic - Understand OData in 6 steps . The Query Builder ERP.net has integrated visual Query Builder. The Query Builder allows building queries, specific to the ERP Instance. When you use the Query Builder, it allows you to select the user-defined data and calculated attributes in that instance. The Query Builder allows the developers to create the query visually and then just re-use the query text, replacing the parameters. To access the Query Builder for DEMODB, go to: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/querybuilder While the query is built, the Query Builder changes its URL. For example, to preview the same query for the first 10 products in the Query Builder, head to: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/querybuilder#General_Products_Products?$top=10 When you press Execute in the Query Builder, you can preview the result both as table and as JSON. NOTE: Pay attention to the link under the selected entity, which opens the documentation for the entity. The Query Tool The Query Tool is simple Postman-like tool for querying the database. It does not have the visual building abilities of the Query Builder. However, it can represent all possible REST requests and is very simple to use. Note The Query Tool is the default tool, which is used to represent queries in forum posts, tickets, etc. To access the Query Tool for DEMODB, go to: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/query Query Basics ERP.net allows only a subset of the full OData queries. Generally, you cannot do JOINs, and filter with OR. However, you can filter by multiple values, like the SQL IN operator: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/odata/General_Products_Products?$top=10&$filter=Id%20in%20(edf2bd2a-7e4d-e111-a06c-00155d00050a,cf728601-1fd5-4853-ab23-01deeee7d038) Instance API Reference Each ERP Instance has its own API reference documentation. The instance-specific API reference documentation is like the Model docs. The main difference is that the reference documentation of a specific ERP Instance lists also the user-defined attributes. The user-defined attributes can be queried mostly like the system attributes. The instance reference documentation of DEMODB is at: https://demodb.my.erp.net/api/domain/docs Tip Since the instance API reference contains user-defined objects from the database, it is accessible only after authentication. For general-purpose information, check the Model . Security Someone said: \"Security is hard, deal with it\". The hard truth is that security today is much harder that it was 10 years ago. Once upon a time, there was a user and a password. Today, we have OAuth with Trusted Apps, Security Tokens, complicated security workflows, and all the other things. There are some good things, though. Single Sign-On, multi-factor authentication, and other extras come to mind. But, at the end of the day, you have to do much more work to create a secure app. ERP.net is based on the OAuth 2 security paradigm with OpenID Connect support. For more information about security, read Introduction to identity in ERP.net . Next Steps Check the Developer Guides for common developer scenarios. The guides contain solutions to common tasks and full runnable sample apps. Read the full Developer Documentation .

REST API The Domain API is a HTTP REST API, which allows access to the data exposed by the ERP.net objects. The API allows access to the data in an object-oriented manner, through a well-known HTTP REST interface, based on the OData v4 protocol. OData The OData API is structured along a number of entities that represent the Domain Model of the ERP Instance. Each entity contains data attributes, which can be filtered, sorted, etc. This model also provides information on how to navigate between entities. Data The Domain API allows access to the ERP Instance data. Server Management cannot be performed through the Domain API. All data in a database is accessible through the Domain API, restricted by the access permissions of the login account. The Domain API is adequate for building productive e-Commerce web sites, data transfer packages and similar apps."

    "keywords": "Authentication Flows Authentication Flows are the process flows, which an external app can use to request access to the ERP Instance. Authorization Code This authorization flow is used by interactive user applications, which access the ERP Instance on behalf of the logged user. If we relate to Tom and Jane scenario, this would be the case when we want Toms app to create the Sales Orders using Jane account and access permissions. Jane wants to start using Toms app to create her Sales Orders. Toms app is generally authorized for the ERP Instance (with Trusted Application record), but Jane has not yet authorized it to work on her behalf! If Toms app presents a login screen to get Janes credentials and use them to access the ERP Instance, this would expose the credentials to the app author. So, instead, the app asks the platform to verify that it is Jane in front of the computer. Toms app requests the ERP Instance to authenticate the user using the browser. Jane is presented with a familiar log-in screen, which is used by ALL apps. Since Jane trusts the platform, she securely enters her user name and password. The ERP Instance validates Janes credentials and creates a special id token . The token is actually just a string, which contains Janes details, like name, profile picture and email. The token is passed back to the app, using the apps Login URL . Now, Toms app knows that it is Jane which is using his app, but without ever gaining access to her credentials! Client Credentials Client Credentials is an authorization flow, with which an app requests service access. The service account, which is used to create the session is configured in the Trusted Application record. Note The service session is not related to any specific interactive user. It can be created on service startup and renewed whenever necessary. Lets relate this to the Tom and Jane scenario from the Overview . With service access, Toms app will create all Sales Orders with the same service account. It would not use Janes or any other user account to access the ERP Instance. The basic flow is the following: Toms app provides its application URI and application secret to the ERP Instance. The URI and secret are much like user name and password, but for application. The ERP Instance looks up the Trusted Application record for Toms app. Based on the Service Account specified in the record, the ERP Instance creates a special access token and passes it to Toms app. The access token is just a string, containing the granted access permissions, which is digitally signed. Toms app uses the access token to call the ERP APIs and create the Sales Orders."

    "title": "Introduction to Identity in ERP.net | ERP.net Developer Docs",
    "keywords": "Introduction to Identity in ERP.net ERP.net APIs use OAuth 2 for authentication and authorization. In OAuth 2, the authentication and authorization is performed by an identity provider. ERP.net has built-in identity provider, which conforms to the OpenID Connect specification. Why do we need OAuth 2? In the good old days of lesser security, there was just a user and a password. If we need to access an app, we enter the user name and the password and voila - we get access! So, what is the problem to continue like this? Suppose Tom has created a good little app, which automates the Sales Order creation. You just select from one of three predefined templates and your sales order is created. The problem is: How should Toms app access your ERP Instance? Option 1 would be to give him your user name and password. OK, but then your user name and password are no longer so secure, aren't they? Even if you don't give them directly to Tom, but \"just\" enter them in a web form, Tom still receives your precious security secret! Option 2 would be ... Can't we can just give Toms app access to the ERP Instance, but without sharing our credentials? This is where OAuth 2 comes in. A group of very clever people have come up with a standard, which allows users to authorize apps to do things on their behalf. Enter the age of platforms and apps . Note To be more precise, it should be called age of Identity providers and apps. But in the current case, the platform is also the Identity provider. Trust an application When you install an app on your phone, you authorize this app to do certain things with your data. The Android or iOS platform allows the app to access only the data you have authorized it to access. You fully trust the platform, but you don't fully trust any app out there. The platform should stop malicious attempts to steal and manipulate your data. Similar, but still a bit more complicated paradigm can be applied to ERP Instances. The administrator of the ERP Instance plays the role of the phone owner. The ERP Instance is the platform and the app is, well, the app. In our phones, before using an app, we need to install it. With ERP Instances, we don't actually install the app, because the app is already hosted somewhere. So, this step is skipped. We just have to tell the system, that we trust this app. Manually trust an application To manually trust an application, you create a Trusted Application record, which informs the ERP Instance, that you trust this application. For more information, see Trusted Applications . Install from a marketplace Another way to trust an application is to activate it from a marketplace. In this case, the marketplace redirects the browser to a \"Register Trusted Application\" endpoint in your ERP Instance. The registration process verifies that you are an administrator of the ERP Instance and then simply asks you if you want to trust this application. Note This is very similar to the way your phone asks you if you trust a new application. Access data in the ERP Instance Once an application is trusted, it can use two ways to access ERP data - through user account or through service access. Interactive applications Interactive applications have UI and use Authorization Code flow to request user access. Service applications Service applications have no UI and use only service accounts. They use the Client Credentials flow to request service access. Note A single application can use both interactive user login and service access to perform different functions.

    "title": "Trusted Applications | ERP.net Developer Docs",
    "keywords": "Trusted Applications A trusted application record tells the system that a specific application is allowed to access the ERP Instance. General information Trusted Application record can be created manually or through a marketplace activation. Anyway, it is good to understand the information stored in such a record. Anatomy of a Trusted Application record A Trusted Application record contains many fields. To better understand them, read below. Name This is the multi-language name of the application. Used mostly for interactive display in UI clients. Not important for the functioning of the application. Application URI This is the application identifier. It is passed as parameter by the applications, when they claim who they are in front of the ERP Instance. The Application URI should be unique for the ERP Instance . Preferably, it should be globally unique, so that the application can be listed in a marketplace. Use short, concise identifier. This will appear in logs and other files. Avoid non-latin and special characters. It is advised, that you incorporate this identifier as constant in your application and use the same URI for all \"trusts\" for your app. Note It is best to base your app URIs on your web site and some extension. For example, mywebsite.com/myapp1 is a good URI. Client Type Client Type specifies the confidentiality abilities of the your application. Client types are: Confidential Public Confidential client applications are able to keep secrets. Public apps are generally unable to hide a secret from an advanced intruder. For example: JavaScript apps, executed in the user browser, are public apps. Generally they cannot hide a secret from an advanced user. If a JavaScript app has a secret in its code, it can easily be revealed (and probably abused). Server executed apps are usually confidential. They are executed in a trusted environment and, if properly secured, can keep a secret. Application Secret Hash This is a bit of a challenge. You have to use a tool to get the hash. Type this in the browser (replace \"mysecret\" with your secret): https://demodb.my.erp.net/sys/tools/sha256?secret=mysecret Basic Authentication Allowed At first, this is a bit confusing. It has effect on the whole ERP Instance. Once we have at least (actually also at most) one application with Basic Authentication = ON, we have allowed Basic Authentication for the whole ERP Instance. Note When someone uses Basic Authentication, it would be considered as access from this app. Impersonate As Community / Internal User Allowed Allows the app to request login from a community (external) or internal user. When both options are OFF, the app would not be allowed to request a user to be authenticated. This is a common scenario for service applications with no UI. If any or both options are ON, the app is allowed to impersonate, e.g. request login. The login would be successful only if the authenticated user is of one of the allowed types. Common scenarios: Service app - both options OFF. Internal interactive app - only Internal users allowed. Public web app - both Community and Internal users allowed. Note Avoid allowing only Community and disallowing Internal users. Usually, community accounts can be freely created by anybody. So, allowing only community accounts could create confusion for the internal users and force them to create a separate, external (community) account. Note It is strongly not recommended for a user to have duplicate accounts, just for the purpose of having both community and internal accounts. Impersonate Login URL This is used only for applications, which use the Authorization Code Flow. It is called after a successful login and receives the generated tokens. Usually, this URL is a dedicated endpoint in the app environment. The endpoint should conform to: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthResponse Impersonate Logout URL Reserved for future extensions. Is Enabled Disables the access of the application. Scope The scope (according to RFC 6749 ) for which the application was trusted. The scope is an unordered list of space-delimited case-sensitive strings. Each string denotes a permission. Note Currently, this option is ignored. The following token scopes are PLANNED for near future developments: update Allows the user application to update data in the ERP Instance. Without this scope, the application can only read data. sec Allows the application to access the security infrastructure of the ERP Instance. Generally, this scope should NEVER be trusted to user apps. Scopes, reserved for future use: profile general crm logistics production finance personaldata System User This is the service user, which will be used to initiate sessions, when the application requests token with Client Credentials . System User Allowed Specifies whether the application is allowed to request service access. System User Login URL Reserved."
